<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Winchester</span>, <i>May</i> 28, 1891<br />
The Royal Garden Inn.</p>
<p>We are doing the English cathedral towns, aunt Celia and
I.&nbsp; Aunt Celia has an intense desire to improve my
mind.&nbsp; Papa told her, when we were leaving Cedarhurst, that
he wouldn&rsquo;t for the world have it too much improved, and
aunt Celia remarked that, so far as she could judge, there was no
immediate danger; with which exchange of hostilities they
parted.</p>
<p>We are traveling under the yoke of an iron itinerary,
warranted neither to bend nor break.&nbsp; It was made out by a
young High Church curate in New York, and if it had been blessed
by all the bishops and popes it could not be more sacred to aunt
Celia.&nbsp; She is awfully High Church, and I believe she thinks
this tour of the cathedrals will give me a taste for ritual and
bring me into the true fold.&nbsp; I have been hearing dear old
Dr. Kyle a great deal lately, and aunt Celia says that he is the
most dangerous Unitarian she knows, because he has leanings
towards Christianity.</p>
<p>Long ago, in her youth, she was engaged to a young
architect.&nbsp; He, with his triangles and T-squares and things,
succeeded in making an imaginary scale-drawing of her heart (up
to that time a virgin forest, an unmapped territory), which
enabled him to enter in and set up a pedestal there, on which he
has remained ever since.&nbsp; He has been only a memory for many
years, to be sure, for he died at the age of twenty-six, before
he had had time to build anything but a livery stable and a
country hotel.&nbsp; This is fortunate, on the whole, because
aunt Celia thinks he was destined to establish American
architecture on a higher plane,&mdash;rid it of its base,
time-serving, imitative instincts, and waft it to a height where,
in the course of centuries, we should have been revered and
followed by all the nations of the earth.&nbsp; I went to see the
livery stable, after one of these Miriam-like flights of prophecy
on the might-have-been.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t fair to judge a
man&rsquo;s promise by one performance, and that one a livery
stable, so I shall say nothing.</p>
<p>This sentiment about architecture and this fondness for the
very toppingest High Church ritual cause aunt Celia to look on
the English cathedrals with solemnity and reverential awe.&nbsp;
She has given me a fat notebook, with &ldquo;Katharine
Schuyler&rdquo; stamped in gold letters on the Russia leather
cover, and a lock and key to protect its feminine
confidences.&nbsp; I am not at all the sort of girl who makes
notes, and I have told her so; but she says that I must at least
record my passing impressions, if they are ever so trivial and
commonplace.</p>
<p>I wanted to go directly from Southampton to London with the
Abbotts, our ship friends, who left us yesterday.&nbsp; Roderick
Abbott and I had had a charming time on board ship (more charming
than aunt Celia knows, because she was very ill, and her natural
powers of chaperoning were severely impaired), and the prospect
of seeing London sights together was not unpleasing; but Roderick
Abbott is not in aunt Celia&rsquo;s itinerary, which reads:
&ldquo;Winchester, Salisbury, Wells, Bath, Bristol, Gloucester,
Oxford, London, Ely, Lincoln, York, Durham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Celia is one of those persons who are born to command,
and when they are thrown in contact with those who are born to be
commanded all goes as merry as a marriage bell; otherwise
not.</p>
<p>So here we are at Winchester; and I don&rsquo;t mind all the
Roderick Abbotts in the universe, now that I have seen the Royal
Garden Inn, its pretty coffee-room opening into the old-fashioned
garden, with its borders of clove pinks, its aviaries, and its
blossoming horse-chestnuts, great towering masses of pink
bloom!</p>
<p>Aunt Celia has driven to St. Cross Hospital with Mrs.
Benedict, an estimable lady tourist whom she &ldquo;picked
up&rdquo; en route from Southampton.&nbsp; I am tired, and stayed
at home.&nbsp; I cannot write letters, because aunt Celia has the
guide-books, so I sit by the window in indolent content, watching
the dear little school laddies, with their short jackets and wide
white collars; they all look so jolly, and rosy, and clean, and
kissable!&nbsp; I should like to kiss the chambermaid, too!&nbsp;
She has a pink print dress; no bangs, thank goodness (it&rsquo;s
curious our servants can&rsquo;t leave that deformity to the
upper classes), but shining brown hair, plump figure, soft voice,
and a most engaging way of saying, &ldquo;Yes, miss?&nbsp;
Anythink more, miss?&rdquo;&nbsp; I long to ask her to sit down
comfortably and be English, while I study her as a type, but of
course I mustn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Sometimes I wish I could retire
from the world for a season and do what I like, &ldquo;surrounded
by the general comfort of being thought mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An elegant, irreproachable, high-minded model of dignity and
reserve has just knocked and inquired what we will have for
dinner.&nbsp; It is very embarrassing to give orders to a person
who looks like a judge of the Supreme Court, but I said
languidly, &ldquo;What would you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like a clear soup, a good spring soup, to
begin with, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a bit of turbot next, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, turbot, by all means,&rdquo; I said, my mouth
watering at the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what for a roast, miss?&nbsp; Would you enjoy a
young duckling, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing; and for dessert&rdquo;&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t think what we ought to have for dessert in
England, but the high-minded model coughed apologetically and
said, &ldquo;I was thinking you might like gooseberry tart and
cream for a sweet, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh that I could have vented my New World enthusiasm in a
shriek of delight as I heard those intoxicating words, heretofore
met only in English novels!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; I said hesitatingly, though I was
palpitating with joy, &ldquo;I fancy we should like gooseberry
tart (here a bright idea entered my mind) and perhaps in case my
aunt doesn&rsquo;t care for the gooseberry tart, you might bring
a lemon squash, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I had never met a lemon squash personally, but I had often
heard of it, and wished to show my familiarity with British
culinary art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One lemon squash, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; I said
haughtily; &ldquo;bring a sufficient number for two
persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Aunt Celia came home in the highest feather.&nbsp; She had
twice been taken for an Englishwoman.&nbsp; She said she thought
that lemon squash was a drink; I thought it was a pie; but we
shall find out at dinner, for, as I said, I ordered a sufficient
number for two persons.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock we attended even-song at the
cathedral.&nbsp; I shall not say what I felt when the
white-surpliced boy choir entered, winding down those vaulted
aisles, or when I heard for the first time that intoned service,
with all its &ldquo;witchcraft of harmonic sound.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
sat quite by myself in a high carved-oak seat, and the hour was
passed in a trance of serene delight.&nbsp; I do not have many
opinions, it is true, but papa says I am always strong on
sentiments; nevertheless, I shall not attempt to tell even what I
feel in these new and beautiful experiences, for it has been
better told a thousand times.</p>
<p>There were a great many people at service, and a large number
of Americans among them, I should think, though we saw no
familiar faces.&nbsp; There was one particularly nice young man,
who looked like a Bostonian.&nbsp; He sat opposite me.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t stare,&mdash;he was too well bred; but when I looked
the other way, he looked at me.&nbsp; Of course I could feel his
eyes,&mdash;anybody can, at least any girl can; but I attended to
every word of the service, and was as good as an angel.&nbsp;
When the procession had filed out and the last strain of the
great organ had rumbled into silence, we went on a tour through
the cathedral, a heterogeneous band, headed by a conscientious
old verger who did his best to enlighten us, and succeeded in
virtually spoiling my pleasure.</p>
<p>After we had finished (think of &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; a
cathedral in an hour or two!), aunt Celia and I, with one or two
others, wandered through the beautiful close, looking at the
exterior from every possible point, and coming at last to a
certain ruined arch which is very famous.&nbsp; It did not strike
me as being remarkable.&nbsp; I could make any number of them
with a pattern, without the least effort.&nbsp; But at any rate,
when told by the verger to gaze upon the beauties of this
wonderful relic and tremble, we were obliged to gaze also upon
the beauties of the aforesaid nice young man, who was sketching
it.&nbsp; As we turned to go away, aunt Celia dropped her
bag.&nbsp; It is one of those detestable, all-absorbing,
all-devouring, thoroughly respectable, but never proud Boston
bags, made of black cloth with leather trimmings, &ldquo;C. Van
T.&rdquo; embroidered on the side, and the top drawn up with
stout cords which pass over the Boston wrist or arm.&nbsp; As for
me, I loathe them, and would not for worlds be seen carrying one,
though I do slip a great many necessaries into aunt
Celia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I hastened to pick up the horrid thing, for fear the nice
young man would feel obliged to do it for me; but, in my
indecorous haste, I caught hold of the wrong end and emptied the
entire contents on the stone flagging.&nbsp; Aunt Celia
didn&rsquo;t notice; she had turned with the verger, lest she
should miss a single word of his inspired testimony.&nbsp; So we
scrambled up the articles together, the nice young man and I; and
oh, I hope I may never look upon his face again!</p>
<p>There were prayer-books and guide-books, a bottle of soda mint
tablets, a spool of dental floss, a Bath bun, a bit of gray frizz
that aunt Celia pins into her steamer cap, a spectacle case, a
brandy flask, and a bonbon box, which broke and scattered cloves
and cardamom seeds.&nbsp; (I hope he guessed aunt Celia is a
dyspeptic, and not intemperate!)&nbsp; All this was hopelessly
vulgar, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded anything if there had
not been a Duchess novel.&nbsp; Of course he thought that it
belonged to me.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t have known aunt Celia was
carrying it for that accidental Mrs. Benedict, with whom she went
to St. Cross Hospital.</p>
<p>After scooping the cardamom seeds out of the cracks in the
stone flagging, he handed me the tattered, disreputable-looking
copy of &ldquo;A Modern Circe&rdquo; with a bow that
wouldn&rsquo;t have disgraced a Chesterfield, and then went back
to his easel, while I fled after aunt Celia and her verger.</p>
<p>Memoranda: The Winchester Cathedral has the longest
nave.&nbsp; The inside is more superb than the outside.&nbsp;
Izaak Walton and Jane Austen are buried there.</p>

The White Swan.</p>
<p>As sure as my name is Jack Copley, I saw the prettiest girl in
the world to-day,&mdash;an American, too, or I&rsquo;m greatly
mistaken.&nbsp; It was in the cathedral, where I have been
sketching for several days.&nbsp; I was sitting in the end of a
seat, at afternoon service, when two ladies entered by the side
door.&nbsp; The ancient maiden, evidently the head of the family,
settled herself devoutly, and the young one stole off by herself
to one of the old carved seats back of the choir.&nbsp; She was
worse than pretty!&nbsp; I took a sketch of her during service,
as she sat under the dark carved-oak canopy, with this Latin
inscription over her head:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Carlton
cum</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Dolby</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Letania</span><br />
<span class="smcap">IX Solidorum</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Super Flumina</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Confitebor tibi</span><br />
<span class="smcap">D&uuml;c Probati</span></p>
<p>There ought to be a law against a woman&rsquo;s making a
picture of herself, unless she is willing to sit and be
sketched.</p>
<p>A black and white sketch doesn&rsquo;t give any definite idea
of this charmer&rsquo;s charms, but some time I&rsquo;ll fill it
in,&mdash;hair, sweet little hat, gown, and eyes, all in golden
brown, a cape of tawny sable slipping off her arm, a knot of
yellow primroses in her girdle, carved-oak background, and the
afternoon sun coming through a stained-glass window.&nbsp; Great
Jove!&nbsp; She had a most curious effect on me, that girl!&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t explain it,&mdash;very curious, altogether new, and
rather pleasant!&nbsp; When one of the choir boys sang, &ldquo;Oh
for the wings of a dove!&rdquo; a tear rolled out of one of her
lovely eyes and down her smooth brown cheek.&nbsp; I would have
given a large portion of my modest monthly income for the
felicity of wiping away that teardrop with one of my new
handkerchiefs, marked with a tremendous &ldquo;C&rdquo; by my
pretty sister.</p>
<p>An hour or two later they appeared again,&mdash;the dragon,
who answers to the name of &ldquo;aunt Celia,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;nut-brown mayde,&rdquo; who comes when you call her
&ldquo;Katharine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was sketching a ruined
arch.&nbsp; The dragon dropped her unmistakably Boston bag.&nbsp;
I expected to see encyclop&aelig;dias and Russian tracts fall
from it, but was disappointed.&nbsp; The nut-brown mayde (who has
been brought up rigidly) hastened to pick up the bag, for fear
that I should serve her by doing it.&nbsp; She was punished by
turning it inside out, and I was rewarded by helping her pick up
the articles, which were many and ill assorted.&nbsp; My little
romance received the first blow when I found that she reads the
Duchess novels.&nbsp; I think, however, she has the grace to be
ashamed of it, for she blushed scarlet when I handed her &ldquo;A
Modern Circe.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could have told her that such a
blush on such a cheek would atone for reading Mrs. Southworth,
but I refrained.&nbsp; After she had gone I discovered a slip of
paper which had blown under some stones.&nbsp; It proved to be an
itinerary.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t return it.&nbsp; I thought they
must know which way they were going; and as this was precisely
what I wanted to know, I kept it for my own use.&nbsp; She is
doing the cathedral towns.&nbsp; I am doing the cathedral
towns.&nbsp; Happy thought!&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t we do them
together,&mdash;we and aunt Celia?</p>
<p>I had only ten minutes&mdash;to catch my train for Salisbury,
but I concluded to run in and glance at the registers of the
principal hotels.&nbsp; Found my nut-brown mayde at once on the
pages of the Royal Garden Inn register: &ldquo;Miss Celia Van
Tyck, Beverly, Mass.; Miss Katharine Schuyler, New
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; I concluded to stay over another train,
ordered dinner, and took an altogether indefensible and
inconsistent pleasure in writing &ldquo;John Quincy Copley,
Cambridge, Mass.,&rdquo; directly beneath the charmer&rsquo;s
autograph.</p>

The White Hart Inn.</p>
<p>We left Winchester on the 1.06 train yesterday, and here we
are within sight of another superb and ancient pile of
stone.&nbsp; I wanted so much to stop at the Highflyer Inn in
Lark Lane, but aunt Celia said that if we were destitute of
personal dignity, we at least owed something to our
ancestors.&nbsp; Aunt Celia has a temperamental distrust of joy
as something dangerous and ensnaring.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t
realize what fun it would be to date one&rsquo;s letters from the
Highflyer Inn, Lark Lane, even if one were obliged to consort
with poachers and cockneys in order to do it.</p>
<p>We attended service at three.&nbsp; The music was lovely, and
there were beautiful stained-glass windows by Burne-Jones and
Morris.&nbsp; The verger (when wound up with a shilling) talked
like an electric doll.&nbsp; If that nice young man is making a
cathedral tour, like ourselves, he isn&rsquo;t taking our route,
for he isn&rsquo;t here.&nbsp; If he has come over for the
purpose of sketching, he wouldn&rsquo;t stop at sketching one
cathedral.&nbsp; Perhaps he began at the other end and worked
down to Winchester.&nbsp; Yes, that must be it, for the Ems
sailed yesterday from Southampton.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>June 2.</p>
<p>We intended to go to Stonehenge this morning, but it rained,
so we took a &ldquo;growler&rdquo; and went to the Earl of
Pembroke&rsquo;s country place to see the pictures.&nbsp; Had a
delightful morning with the magnificent antiques, curios, and
portraits.&nbsp; The Van Dyck room is a joy forever.&nbsp; There
were other visitors; nobody who looked especially
interesting.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t like Salisbury so well as
Winchester.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know why.&nbsp; We shall drive this
afternoon, if it is fair, and go to Wells to-morrow.&nbsp; Must
read Baedeker on the bishop&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; Oh dear! if one
could only have a good time and not try to know anything!</p>
<p>Memoranda: <i>This cathedral has the highest spire</i>.&nbsp;

The Red Lion.</p>
<p>I went off on a long tramp this afternoon, and coming on a
pretty river flowing through green meadows, with a fringe of
trees on either side, I sat down to make a sketch.&nbsp; I heard
feminine voices in the vicinity, but, as these are generally a
part of the landscape in the tourist season, I paid no special
notice.&nbsp; Suddenly a dainty patent-leather shoe floated
towards me on the surface of the stream.&nbsp; It evidently had
just dropped in, for it was right side up with care, and was
disporting itself right merrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did ever
Jove&rsquo;s tree drop such fruit?&rdquo; I quoted, as I fished
it out on my stick; and just then I heard a distressed voice
saying, &ldquo;Oh, aunt Celia, I&rsquo;ve lost my smart little
London shoe.&nbsp; I was sitting in a tree, taking a pebble out
of the heel, when I saw a caterpillar, and I dropped it into the
river, the shoe, you know, not the caterpillar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hereupon she came in sight, and I witnessed the somewhat unusual
spectacle of my nut-brown mayde hopping on one foot, like a
divine stork, and ever and anon emitting a feminine shriek as her
off foot, clad in a delicate silk stocking, came in contact with
the ground.&nbsp; I rose quickly, and, polishing the patent
leather ostentatiously, inside and out, with my handkerchief, I
offered it to her with distinguished grace.&nbsp; She swayed on
her one foot with as much dignity as possible, and then
recognizing me as the person who picked up the contents of aunt
Celia&rsquo;s bag, she said, dimpling in the most distracting
manner (that&rsquo;s another thing there ought to be a law
against), &ldquo;Thank you again; you seem to be a sort of
knight-errant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I&mdash;assist you?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; (I
might have known that this was going too far.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said, with polar
frigidity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
hopped back to her aunt Celia without another word.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to approach aunt Celia.&nbsp; She is
formidable.&nbsp; By a curious accident of feature, for which she
is not in the least responsible, she always wears an unfortunate
expression as of one perceiving some offensive odor in the
immediate vicinity.&nbsp; This may be a mere accident of high
birth.&nbsp; It is the kind of nose often seen in the
&ldquo;first families,&rdquo; and her name betrays the fact that
she is of good old Knickerbocker origin.&nbsp; We go to Wells
to-morrow.&nbsp; At least I think we do.</p>
<h2>SHE</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <i>June</i> 9<br />
The Spread Eagle.</p>
<p>I met him at Wells, and again at Bath.&nbsp; We are always
being ridiculous, and he is always rescuing us.&nbsp; Aunt Celia
never really sees him, and thus never recognizes him when he
appears again, always as the flower of chivalry and guardian of
ladies in distress.&nbsp; I will never again travel abroad
without a man, even if I have to hire one from a Feeble-Minded
Asylum.&nbsp; We work like galley slaves, aunt Celia and I,
finding out about trains and things.&nbsp; Neither of us can
understand Bradshaw, and I can&rsquo;t even grapple with the
lesser intricacies of the A B C railway guide.&nbsp; The trains,
so far as I can see, always arrive before they go out, and I can
never tell whether to read up the page or down.&nbsp; It is
certainly very queer that the stupidest man that breathes, one
that barely escapes idiocy, can disentangle a railway guide, when
the brightest woman fails.&nbsp; Even the Boots at the inn in
Wells took my book, and, rubbing his frightfully dirty finger
down the row of puzzling figures, found the place in a minute,
and said, &ldquo;There ye are, miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is very
humiliating.&nbsp; All the time I have left from the study of
routes and hotels I spend on guide-books.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m
sure that if any one of the men I know were here, he could tell
me all that is necessary as we walk along the streets.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say it in a frivolous or sentimental spirit in the
least, but I do affirm that there is hardly any juncture in life
where one isn&rsquo;t better off for having a man about.&nbsp; I
should never dare divulge this to aunt Celia, for she
doesn&rsquo;t think men very nice.&nbsp; She excludes them from
conversation as if they were indelicate subjects.</p>
<p>But, to go on, we were standing at the door of Ye Olde Bell
and Horns, at Bath, waiting for the fly which we had ordered to
take us to the station, when who should drive up in a
four-wheeler but the flower of chivalry.&nbsp; Aunt Celia was
saying very audibly, &ldquo;We shall certainly miss the train if
the man doesn&rsquo;t come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray take this fly,&rdquo; said the flower of
chivalry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not leaving till the next
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Celia got in without a murmur; I sneaked in after
her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she looked at him, though she did
vouchsafe the remark that he seemed to be a civil sort of
person.</p>
<p>At Bristol, I was walking about by myself, and I espied a
sign, &ldquo;Martha Huggins, Licensed Victualer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was a nice, tidy little shop, with a fire on the hearth and
flowers in the window, and, as it was raining smartly, I thought
no one would catch me if I stepped inside to chat with
Martha.&nbsp; I fancied it would be so delightful and Dickensy to
talk quietly with a licensed victualer by the name of Martha
Huggins.</p>
<p>Just after I had settled myself, the flower of chivalry came
in and ordered ale.&nbsp; I was disconcerted at being found in a
dramshop alone, for I thought, after the bag episode, he might
fancy us a family of inebriates.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t evince
the slightest astonishment; he merely lifted his hat, and walked
out after he had finished his ale.&nbsp; He certainly has the
loveliest manners!</p>
<p>And so it goes on, and we never get any further.&nbsp; I like
his politeness and his evident feeling that I can&rsquo;t be
flirted and talked with like a forward boarding-school miss, but
I must say I don&rsquo;t think much of his ingenuity.&nbsp; Of
course one can&rsquo;t have all the virtues, but, if I were he, I
would part with my distinguished air, my charming ease, in fact
almost anything, if I could have in exchange a few grains of
common sense, just enough to guide me in the practical affairs of
life.</p>
<p>I wonder what he is?&nbsp; He might be an artist, but he
doesn&rsquo;t seem quite like an artist; or a dilettante, but he
doesn&rsquo;t seem in the least like a dilettante.&nbsp; Or he
might be an architect; I think that is the most probable guess of
all.&nbsp; Perhaps he is only &ldquo;going to be&rdquo; one of
these things, for he can&rsquo;t be more than twenty-five or
twenty-six.&nbsp; Still he looks as if he were something already;
that is, he has a kind of self-reliance in his mien,&mdash;not
self-assertion, nor self-esteem, but belief in self, as if he
were able, and knew that he was able, to conquer
circumstances.</p>

<p>Nothing accomplished yet.&nbsp; Her aunt is a Van Tyck, and a
stiff one, too.&nbsp; I am a Copley, and that delays
matters.&nbsp; Much depends upon the manner of approach.&nbsp; A
false move would be fatal.&nbsp; We have six more towns (as per
itinerary), and if their thirst for cathedrals isn&rsquo;t slaked
when these are finished we have the entire continent to do.&nbsp;
If I could only succeed in making an impression on the retina of
aunt Celia&rsquo;s eye!&nbsp; Though I have been under her feet
for ten days, she never yet has observed me.&nbsp; This
absent-mindedness of hers serves me ill now, but it may prove a

The Mitre.</p>
<p>It was here in Oxford that a grain of common sense entered the
brain of the flower of chivalry.&nbsp; You might call it the dawn
of reason.&nbsp; We had spent part of the morning in High Street,
&ldquo;the noblest old street in England,&rdquo; as our dear
Hawthorne calls it.&nbsp; As Wordsworth had written a sonnet
about it, aunt Celia was armed for the fray,&mdash;a volume of
Wordsworth in one hand, and one of Hawthorne in the other.&nbsp;
(I wish Baedeker didn&rsquo;t give such full information about
what one ought to read before one can approach these places in a
proper spirit.)&nbsp; When we had done High Street, we went to
Magdalen College, and sat down on a bench in Addison&rsquo;s
Walk, where aunt Celia proceeded to store my mind with the
principal facts of Addison&rsquo;s career, and his influence on
the literature of the something or other century.&nbsp; The
cramming process over, we wandered along, and came upon
&ldquo;him&rdquo; sketching a shady corner of the walk.</p>
<p>Aunt Celia went up behind him, and, Van Tyck though she is,
she could not restrain her admiration of his work.&nbsp; I was
surprised myself: I didn&rsquo;t suppose so good looking a youth
could do such good work.&nbsp; I retired to a safe distance, and
they chatted together.&nbsp; He offered her the sketch; she
refused to take advantage of his kindness.&nbsp; He said he would
&ldquo;dash off&rdquo; another that evening, and bring it to our
hotel,&mdash;&ldquo;so glad to do anything for a
fellow-countryman,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; I peeped from behind a tree
and saw him give her his card.&nbsp; It was an awful moment; I
trembled, but she read it with unmistakable approval, and gave
him her own with an expression that meant, &ldquo;Yours is good,
but beat that if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called to me, and I appeared.&nbsp; Mr. John Quincy
Copley, Cambridge, was presented to her niece, Miss Katharine
Schuyler, New York.&nbsp; It was over, and a very small thing to
take so long about, too.</p>
<p>He is an architect, and of course has a smooth path into aunt
Celia&rsquo;s affections.&nbsp; Theological students, ministers,
missionaries, heroes, and martyrs she may distrust, but
architects never!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an architect, my dear Katharine, and he is a
Copley,&rdquo; she told me afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never knew
a Copley who was not respectable, and many of them have been
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the introduction was over, aunt Celia asked him
guilelessly if he had visited any other of the English
cathedrals.&nbsp; Any others, indeed!&nbsp; This to a youth who
had been all but in her lap for a fortnight!&nbsp; It was a blow,
but he rallied bravely, and, with an amused look in my direction,
replied discreetly that he had visited most of them at one time
or another.&nbsp; I refused to let him see that I had ever
noticed him before; that is, particularly.</p>
<p>Memoranda: &ldquo;The very stones and mortar of this historic
town seem impregnated with the spirit of restful
antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Extract from one of aunt Celia&rsquo;s
letters.)&nbsp; Among the great men who have studied here are the
Prince of Wales, Duke of Wellington, Gladstone, Sir Robert Peel,
Sir Philip Sidney, William Penn, John Locke, the two Wesleys,
Ruskin, Ben Jonson, and Thomas Otway.&nbsp; (Look Otway up.)</p>

<p>I have done it, and if I hadn&rsquo;t been a fool and a coward
I might have done it a week ago, and spared myself a good deal of
delicious torment.&nbsp; I have just given two hours to a sketch
of Addison&rsquo;s Walk and carried it to aunt Celia at the
Mitre.&nbsp; Object, to find out whether they make a long stay in
London (our next point), and if so where.&nbsp; It seems they go
directly through.&nbsp; I said in the course of conversation,
&ldquo;So Miss Schuyler is willing to forego a London
season?&nbsp; Marvelous self-denial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece did not come to Europe for a London
season,&rdquo; replied Miss Van Tyck.&nbsp; &ldquo;We go through
London this time merely as a cathedral town, simply because it
chances to be where it is geographically.&nbsp; We shall visit
St. Paul&rsquo;s and Westminster Abbey, and then go directly on,
that our chain of impressions may have absolute continuity and be
free from any disturbing elements.&rdquo;</p>

At Miss Brown&rsquo;s, Castle Garden.</p>
<p>Mr. Copley <i>has</i> done something in the world; I was sure
that he had.&nbsp; He has a little income of his own, but he is
too proud and ambitious to be an idler.&nbsp; He looked so manly
when he talked about it, standing up straight and strong in his
knickerbockers.&nbsp; I like men in knickerbockers.&nbsp; Aunt
Celia doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She says she doesn&rsquo;t see how a
well-brought-up Copley can go about with his legs in that
condition.&nbsp; I would give worlds to know how aunt Celia ever
unbent sufficiently to get engaged.&nbsp; But, as I was saying,
Mr. Copley has accomplished something, young as he is.&nbsp; He
has built three picturesque suburban churches suitable for
weddings, and a state lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>Aunt Celia says we shall have no worthy architecture until
every building is made an exquisitely sincere representation of
its deepest purpose,&mdash;a symbol, as it were, of its
indwelling meaning.&nbsp; I should think it would be very
difficult to design a lunatic asylum on that basis, but I
didn&rsquo;t dare say so, as Mr. Copley seemed to think it all
right.&nbsp; Their conversation is absolutely sublimated when
they get to talking of architecture.&nbsp; I have just copied two
quotations from Emerson, and am studying them every night for
fifteen minutes before I go to sleep.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to
quote them some time offhand, just after morning service, when we
are wandering about the cathedral grounds.&nbsp; The first is
this: &ldquo;The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone,
subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man.&nbsp; The
mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower, with the
lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportion
and perspective of vegetable beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then when he
has recovered from the shock of this, here is my second:
&ldquo;Nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford
and English cathedrals without feeling that the forest
overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw
and plane, still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its
locust, elm, pine, and spruce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Memoranda: <i>Lincoln choir is an example of Early English or
First Pointed</i>, <i>which can generally be told from something
else by bold projecting buttresses and dog-tooth moulding round
the abacusses</i>.&nbsp; (The plural is my own, and it does not
look right.)&nbsp; <i>Lincoln Castle was the scene of many
prolonged sieges</i>, <i>and was once taken by Oliver
Cromwell</i>.</p>

The Black Swan.</p>
<p>Kitty Schuyler is the concentrated essence of feminine
witchery.&nbsp; Intuition strong, logic weak, and the two
qualities so balanced as to produce an indefinable charm;
will-power large, but docility equal, if a man is clever enough
to know how to manage her; knowledge of facts absolutely nil, but
she is exquisitely intelligent in spite of it.&nbsp; She has a
way of evading, escaping, eluding, and then gives you an
intoxicating hint of sudden and complete surrender.&nbsp; She is
divinely innocent, but roguishness saves her from
insipidity.&nbsp; Her looks?&nbsp; She looks as you would imagine
a person might look who possessed these graces; and she is worth
looking at, though every time I do it I have a rush of love to
the head.&nbsp; When you find a girl who combines all the
qualities you have imagined in the ideal, and who has added a
dozen or two on her own account, merely to distract you past all
hope, why stand up and try to resist her charm?&nbsp; Down on
your knees like a man, say I!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting to adore aunt Celia.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
care for her at first, but she is so deliciously blind!&nbsp;
Anything more exquisitely unserviceable as a chaperon I
can&rsquo;t imagine.&nbsp; Absorbed in antiquity, she ignores the
babble of contemporaneous lovers.&nbsp; That any man could look
at Kitty when he could look at a cathedral passes her
comprehension.&nbsp; I do not presume too greatly on her
absent-mindedness, however, lest she should turn unexpectedly and
rend me.&nbsp; I always remember that inscription on the backs of
the little mechanical French toys,&mdash;&ldquo;Quoiqu&rsquo;elle
soit tr&egrave;s solidement mont&eacute;e, il faut ne pas
brutaliser la machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so my courtship progresses under aunt Celia&rsquo;s very
nose.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;progresses,&rdquo; but it is impossible
to speak with any certainty of courting, for the essence of that
gentle craft is hope, rooted in labor and trained by love.</p>
<p>I set out to propose to her during service this afternoon by
writing my feelings on the fly-leaf of the hymn-book, or
something like that; but I knew that aunt Celia would never
forgive such blasphemy, and I thought that Kitty herself might
consider it wicked.&nbsp; Besides, if she should chance to accept
me, there was nothing I could do, in a cathedral, to relieve my
feelings.&nbsp; No; if she ever accepts me, I wish it to be in a
large, vacant spot of the universe, peopled by two only, and
those two so indistinguishably blended, as it were, that they
would appear as one to the casual observer.&nbsp; So I practiced
repression, though the wall of my reserve is worn to the thinness
of thread-paper, and I tried to keep my mind on the droning minor
canon, and not to look at her, &ldquo;for that way madness
lies.&rdquo;</p>

High Petersgate Street.</p>
<p>My taste is so bad!&nbsp; I just begin to realize it, and I am
feeling my &ldquo;growing pains,&rdquo; like Gwendolen in
&ldquo;Daniel Deronda.&rdquo;&nbsp; I admired the stained glass
in the Lincoln Cathedral, especially the Nuremberg window.&nbsp;
I thought Mr. Copley looked pained, but he said nothing.&nbsp;
When I went to my room, I looked in a book and found that all the
glass in that cathedral is very modern and very bad, and the
Nuremberg window is the worst of all.&nbsp; Aunt Celia says she
hopes that it will be a warning to me to read before I speak; but
Mr. Copley says no, that the world would lose more in one way
than it would gain in the other.&nbsp; I tried my quotations this
morning, and stuck fast in the middle of the first.</p>
<p>Mr. Copley says that aunt Celia has been feeing the vergers
altogether too much, and I wrote a song about it called
&ldquo;The Ballad of the Vergers and the Foolish Virgin,&rdquo;
which I sang to my guitar.&nbsp; Mr. Copley says it is cleverer
than anything he ever did with his pencil, but of course he says
that only to be agreeable.</p>
<p>We all went to an evening service last night.&nbsp; Coming
home, aunt Celia walked ahead with Mrs. Benedict, who keeps
turning up at the most unexpected moments.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
going to build a Gothicky memorial chapel somewhere.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know for whom, unless it&rsquo;s for Benedict
Arnold.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like her in the least, but four is
certainly a more comfortable number than three.&nbsp; I scarcely
ever have a moment alone with Mr. Copley; for go where I will and
do what I please, aunt Celia has the most perfect confidence in
my indiscretion, so she is always <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>.</p>
<p>Just as we were turning into the quiet little street where we
are lodging I said, &ldquo;Oh dear, I wish that I knew something
about architecture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know anything about it, you are
certainly responsible for a good deal of it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Copley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; How do you mean?&rdquo; I asked quite
innocently, because I couldn&rsquo;t see how he could twist such
a remark as that into anything like sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never built so many castles in my life as since
I&rsquo;ve known you, Miss Schuyler,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I answered as lightly as I could,
&ldquo;air-castles don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building of air-castles is an innocent amusement
enough, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
committing the folly of living in mine.&nbsp; I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Then I was frightened.&nbsp; When, all at once, you find you
have something precious you only dimly suspected was to be yours,
you almost wish it hadn&rsquo;t come so soon.&nbsp; But just at
that moment Mrs. Benedict called to us, and came tramping back
from the gate, and hooked her supercilious, patronizing arm in
Mr. Copley&rsquo;s, and asked him into the sitting-room to talk
over the &ldquo;lady chapel&rdquo; in her new memorial
church.&nbsp; Then aunt Celia told me they would excuse me, as I
had had a wearisome day; and there was nothing for me to do but
to go to bed, like a snubbed child, and wonder if I should ever
know the end of that sentence.&nbsp; And I listened at the head
of the stairs, shivering, but all that I could hear was that Mrs.
Benedict asked Mr. Copley to be her own architect.&nbsp; Her
architect indeed!&nbsp; That woman ought not to be at large!</p>

At Farmer Hendry&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We left York this morning, and arrived here about eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It seems there is some sort of an election
going on in the town, and there was not a single fly at the
station.&nbsp; Mr. Copley walked about in every direction, but
neither horse nor vehicle was to be had for love nor money.&nbsp;
At last we started to walk to the village, Mr. Copley so laden
with our hand-luggage that he resembled a pack-mule.&nbsp; We
made a tour of the inns, but not a single room was to be had, not
for that night nor for three days ahead, on account of that same
election.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go on to Edinburgh, aunt
Celia?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edinburgh?&nbsp; Never!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you suppose that I would voluntarily spend a Sunday in
those bare Presbyterian churches until the memory of these past
ideal weeks has faded a little from my memory?&nbsp; What, leave
out Durham and spoil the set?&rdquo;&nbsp; (She spoke of the
cathedrals as if they were souvenir spoons.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I
intended to stay here for a week or more, and write up a record
of our entire trip from Winchester while the impressions were
fresh in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had intended doing the same thing,&rdquo; said
Mr. Copley.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is, I hoped to finish off my
previous sketches, which are in a frightful state of
incompletion, and spend a good deal of time on the interior of
this cathedral, which is unusually beautiful.&rdquo;&nbsp; (At
this juncture aunt Celia disappeared for a moment to ask the
barmaid if, in her opinion, the constant consumption of malt
liquors prevents a more dangerous indulgence in brandy and
whiskey.&nbsp; She is gathering statistics, but as the barmaids
can never collect their thoughts while they are drawing ale, aunt
Celia proceeds slowly.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said I, with mock humility,
&ldquo;I am a docile person who never has any intentions of her
own, but who yields herself sweetly to the intentions of other
people in her immediate vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Copley, taking out his
pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said so.&nbsp; What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely taking note of your statement, that&rsquo;s
all.&mdash;Now, Miss Van Tyck, I have a plan to propose.&nbsp; I
was here last summer with a couple of Harvard men, and we lodged
at a farmhouse half a mile from the cathedral.&nbsp; If you will
step into the coffee-room of the Shoulder of Mutton and
Cauliflower for an hour, I&rsquo;ll walk up to Farmer
Hendry&rsquo;s and see if they will take us in.&nbsp; I think we
might be fairly comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can aunt Celia have Apollinaris and black coffee after
her morning bath?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Katharine,&rdquo; said aunt Celia
majestically,&mdash;&ldquo;I hope that I can accommodate myself
to circumstances.&nbsp; If Mr. Copley can secure lodgings for us,
I shall be more than grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here we are, all lodging together in an ideal English
farmhouse.&nbsp; There is a thatched roof on one of the old
buildings, and the dairy house is covered with ivy, and Farmer
Hendry&rsquo;s wife makes a real English courtesy, and there are
herds of beautiful sleek Durham cattle, and the butter and cream
and eggs and mutton are delicious; and I never, never want to go
home any more.&nbsp; I want to live here forever, and wave the
American flag on Washington&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>I am so happy that I feel as if something were going to spoil
it all.&nbsp; Twenty years old to-day!&nbsp; I wish mamma were
alive to wish me many happy returns.</p>
<p>Memoranda: Casual remark for breakfast table or perhaps for
luncheon,&mdash;it is a trifle heavy for breakfast: &ldquo;Since
the sixteenth century and despite the work of Inigo Jones and the
great Wren (not Jenny Wren&mdash;Christopher), architecture has
had, in England especially, no legitimate development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O child of fortune, thy name is J. Q. Copley!&nbsp; How did it
happen to be election time?&nbsp; Why did the inns chance to be
full?&nbsp; How did aunt Celia relax sufficiently to allow me to
find her a lodging?&nbsp; Why did she fall in love with the
lodging when found?&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; I only know Fate
smiles; that Kitty and I eat our morning bacon and eggs together;
that I carve Kitty&rsquo;s cold beef and pour Kitty&rsquo;s
sparkling ale at luncheon; that I go to vespers with Kitty, and
dine with Kitty, and walk in the gloaming with Kitty&mdash;and
aunt Celia.&nbsp; And after a day of heaven like this, like Lorna
Doone&rsquo;s lover,&mdash;ay, and like every other lover, I
suppose,&mdash;I go to sleep, and the roof above me swarms with
angels, having Kitty under it!</p>
<p>We were coming home from afternoon service, Kitty and I.&nbsp;
(I am anticipating for she was &ldquo;Miss Schuyler&rdquo; then,
but never mind.)&nbsp; We were walking through the fields, while
Mrs. Benedict and aunt Celia were driving.&nbsp; As we came
across a corner of the bit of meadow land that joins the stable
and the garden, we heard a muffled roar, and as we looked round
we saw a creature with tossing horns and waving tail making for
us, head down, eyes flashing.&nbsp; Kitty gave a shriek.&nbsp; We
chanced to be near a pair of low bars.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t been
a college athlete for nothing.&nbsp; I swung Kitty over the bars,
and jumped after her.&nbsp; But she, not knowing in her fright
where she was nor what she was doing; supposing, also, that the
mad creature, like the villain in the play, would &ldquo;still
pursue her,&rdquo; flung herself bodily into my arms, crying,
&ldquo;Jack! Jack!&nbsp; Save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the first time she had called me Jack,&rdquo;
and I needed no second invitation.&nbsp; I proceeded to save
her,&mdash;in the usual way, by holding her to my heart and
kissing her lovely hair reassuringly, as I murmured: &ldquo;You
are safe, my darling; not a hair of your precious head shall be
hurt.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered like a leaf.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am frightened,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help being frightened.&nbsp;
He will chase us, I know.&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp; What is he
doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking up to determine if I need abbreviate this blissful
moment, I saw the enraged animal disappearing in the side door of
the barn; and it was a nice, comfortable Durham cow,&mdash;that
somewhat rare but possible thing, a sportive cow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; breathed Kitty from my
waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is gone&mdash;she is gone, darling.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t move; it may come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My first too hasty assurance had calmed Kitty&rsquo;s fears,
and she raised her charming flushed face from its retreat and
prepared to withdraw.&nbsp; I did not facilitate the
preparations, and a moment of awkward silence ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I inquire,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;if the dear
little person at present reposing in my arms will stay there
(with intervals for rest and refreshment) for the rest of her
natural life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew entirely now, all but her hand, and her eyes
sought the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall have to now,&mdash;that is, if you
think&mdash;at least, I suppose you do think&mdash;at any rate,
you look as if you were thinking&mdash;that this has been giving
you encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed,&mdash;decisive, undoubted, barefaced
encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ought to be judged as if I were
in my sober senses,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
frightened within an inch of my life.&nbsp; I told you this
morning that I was dreadfully afraid of bulls, especially mad
ones, and I told you that my nurse frightened me, when I was a
child, with awful stories about them, and that I never outgrew my
childish terror.&nbsp; I looked everywhere about: the barn was
too far, the fence too high, I saw him coming, and there was
nothing but you and the open country; of course I took you.&nbsp;
It was very natural, I&rsquo;m sure,&mdash;any girl would have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; I replied soothingly, &ldquo;any
girl would have run after me, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say any girl would have run after
you,&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself; and besides, I
think I was really trying to protect you as well as to gain
protection; else why should I have cast myself on you like a
catamount, or a catacomb, or whatever the thing is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, darling, I thank you for saving my life, and I am
willing to devote the remainder of it to your service as a pledge
of my gratitude; but if you should take up life-saving as a
profession, dear, don&rsquo;t throw yourself on a fellow
with&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack!&rdquo; she cried, putting her hand over my
lips, and getting it well kissed in consequence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you will only forget that, and never, never taunt me with it
afterwards, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll do
anything in reason; yes, even marry you!&rdquo;</p>

The Royal Fountain.</p>
<p>I was never sure enough of Kitty, at first, to dare risk
telling her about that little mistake of hers.&nbsp; She is such
an elusive person that I spend all my time in wooing her, and can
never lay flattering unction to my soul that she is really
won.</p>
<p>But after aunt Celia had looked up my family record and given
a provisional consent, and papa Schuyler had cabled a reluctant
blessing, I did not feel capable of any further
self-restraint.</p>
<p>It was twilight here in Canterbury, and we were sitting on the
vine-shaded veranda of aunt Celia&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp;
Kitty&rsquo;s head was on my shoulder.&nbsp; There is something
very queer about that; when Kitty&rsquo;s head is on my shoulder,
I am not capable of any consecutive train of thought.&nbsp; When
she puts it there I see stars, then myriads of stars, then, oh! I
can&rsquo;t begin to enumerate the steps by which ecstasy mounts
to delirium; but at all events, any operation which demands
exclusive use of the intellect is beyond me at these times.&nbsp;
Still I gathered my stray wits together and said,
&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that nothing but death or marriage can separate us,
I have something to confess to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said serenely, &ldquo;I know what you
are going to say.&nbsp; He was a cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lifted her head from my shoulder sternly, and gazed into her
childlike, candid eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mountain of deceit!&nbsp; How long have you known
about it?&rdquo;</p>

me in that way!&nbsp; Not the very first, not when I&mdash;not
when you&mdash;not when we&mdash;no, not then, but the next
morning I said to Farmer Hendry, &lsquo;I wish you would keep
your savage bull chained up while we are here; aunt Celia is
awfully afraid of them, especially those that go mad, like
yours!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, miss,&rsquo; said Farmer
Hendry, &lsquo;he haven&rsquo;t been pastured here for three

nothing but gentle cows in the home medder.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I

that Winchester has the longest spire and Salisbury the highest

that he was buried in&mdash;well, he was buried in one of those

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
